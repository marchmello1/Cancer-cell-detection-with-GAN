# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Generation

This code implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image generation using TensorFlow and Keras. The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator that compete against each other to generate realistic images.

## Dataset

The code uses the HAM10000 dataset, which contains images of skin lesions. The dataset is split into two parts: metadata and images. The metadata file contains information about the images, such as diagnosis, age, sex, and localization. The images folder contains the actual image files.

## Preprocessing

The metadata file is loaded using pandas, and unnecessary columns are dropped. The diagnosis column is label-encoded using scikit-learn's LabelEncoder.

The image files are loaded, resized to 32x32 pixels, and converted to NumPy arrays. The pixel values are normalized between 0 and 1.

## Model Architecture

The GAN consists of two models: a generator and a discriminator.

### Generator

The generator model is a sequential model built using Keras. It takes a random noise vector as input and generates an image. The generator is trained to generate images that are realistic and can fool the discriminator.

### Discriminator

The discriminator model is also a sequential model built using Keras. It takes an image as input and predicts whether the image is real or generated by the generator. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated images.

## Training

The GAN is trained using a two-step process: training the discriminator and training the generator.

During each training iteration, a batch of real images and a batch of generated images are fed into the discriminator. The discriminator is trained to classify real and generated images correctly. Then, the generator is trained to generate images that the discriminator classifies as real.

The training process is repeated for multiple epochs, with the generator and discriminator updating their weights to improve their performance.

## Results

After training, the generator is used to generate images by feeding random noise vectors. The generated images can be evaluated using the discriminator to measure their quality.

## Dependencies

- NumPy
